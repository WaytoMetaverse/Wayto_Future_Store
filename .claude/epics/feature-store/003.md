# Task: Material Selection and Furniture Placement System

## Description
Implement the material selection interface for walls and furniture placement system with drag-drop functionality, collision detection, and wall snapping. Includes database synchronization for material library management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Material selector interface with categories (paint, wallpaper, tile, etc.)
- [ ] Per-wall material assignment with visual preview
- [ ] Database-synced material library with auto-refresh
- [ ] Furniture palette with drag-drop placement onto floor plan
- [ ] Furniture rotation in 15Â° increments with keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Wall snapping and collision detection for furniture placement
- [ ] Size validation ensuring furniture fits within room boundaries
- [ ] Material and furniture preview thumbnails with loading states
- [ ] Bulk operations for applying materials to multiple walls

## Technical Details
**Material Management:**
- `MaterialSelector` component with category filtering and search
- `MaterialPreview` with real-time texture application to wall segments
- Database integration for material CRUD operations with caching
- Optimistic updates with conflict resolution for concurrent edits

**Furniture System:**
- `FurniturePalette` with categorized object library
- `ObjectPlacer` with drag-drop from palette to canvas
- `CollisionDetector` for object-object and object-wall collision detection
- `SnapManager` for automatic wall alignment and grid positioning

**State Management:**
- Material library store with auto-sync from backend API
- Object placement store with spatial indexing for performance
- Selection state management for multi-object operations
- History tracking for material and furniture placement changes

**Performance Considerations:**
- Lazy loading of material thumbnails and furniture previews
- Spatial partitioning for efficient collision detection
- Canvas layer optimization for furniture rendering
- Debounced API calls for material database synchronization

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Database schema and API endpoints for materials
- [ ] Task 002: Canvas foundation and wall drawing system
- [ ] Material texture assets and furniture 3D model previews
- [ ] Backend API for material and furniture catalog management

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside Unreal development)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Users can assign different materials to individual walls
- [ ] Material changes reflect immediately in visual preview
- [ ] Furniture can be placed and positioned accurately using drag-drop
- [ ] Collision detection prevents overlapping furniture placement
- [ ] Material library synchronizes with database changes automatically
- [ ] System handles 50+ furniture objects without performance degradation
- [ ] All material and furniture operations are covered by unit tests
