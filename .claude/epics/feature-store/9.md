# Task: End-to-End Integration and System Testing

## Description
Implement comprehensive integration testing, performance optimization, and end-to-end workflow validation for the complete interior design platform. Ensures all components work together seamlessly from floor plan creation to final render output.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete end-to-end workflow testing (design → JSON → render → display)
- [ ] Performance optimization for complex layouts (20+ walls, 50+ objects)
- [ ] Error handling and recovery mechanisms across all system boundaries
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent users and render jobs
- [ ] Data consistency validation between frontend, backend, and Unreal
- [ ] Automated test suite covering all critical user journeys
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and optimization documentation
- [ ] Production deployment configuration and monitoring setup
- [ ] User acceptance testing with real-world scenarios

## Technical Details
**Integration Testing Framework:**
- End-to-end tests using Playwright for complete user workflows
- API integration tests for all backend endpoints
- Unreal automation tests for geometry generation accuracy
- Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, different browsers)

**Performance Testing:**
- Load testing with concurrent users creating complex layouts
- Render queue stress testing with multiple simultaneous jobs
- Memory usage profiling for large scenes and extended sessions
- Database performance optimization for large material libraries

**Data Validation:**
- JSON schema compliance testing across all system boundaries
- Geometric accuracy validation (frontend vs Unreal positioning)
- Material application accuracy testing (100% correctness requirement)
- Asset loading and caching performance validation

**Error Recovery Testing:**
- Network disconnection scenarios and reconnection handling
- Partial render failures and automatic retry mechanisms
- Invalid input handling and graceful degradation
- Database connection failures and recovery procedures

**Production Readiness:**
- CI/CD pipeline configuration for automated testing and deployment
- Monitoring setup with alerts for render failures and performance issues
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Security audit and penetration testing

## Dependencies
- [ ] All previous tasks completed and functional
- [ ] Production environment setup (AWS/Azure infrastructure)
- [ ] Monitoring tools (Grafana, CloudWatch, or equivalent)
- [ ] SSL certificates and domain configuration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all components to be completed)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All critical user journeys tested and working end-to-end
- [ ] System performance meets requirements under load
- [ ] Error handling robust across all failure scenarios
- [ ] Automated test suite provides comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Production deployment successful with monitoring active
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented and meeting targets
- [ ] User acceptance criteria validated with stakeholder approval
- [ ] System ready for production launch with confidence
