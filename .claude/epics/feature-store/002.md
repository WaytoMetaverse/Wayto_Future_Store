# Task: 2D Floor Plan Editor with Canvas Drawing

## Description
Implement the core 2D floor plan editor using Konva.js canvas for wall drawing, door/window placement, and real-time geometric validation. This forms the foundation of the user interface for creating interior layouts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Wall drawing with point-to-point construction (click to place walls)
- [ ] Wall editing capabilities (thickness, height, material assignment)
- [ ] Door and window placement on wall segments with centerParam positioning
- [ ] Real-time geometric validation (self-intersection, overlap detection)
- [ ] Visual feedback for invalid geometry with correction suggestions
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality for all drawing operations
- [ ] Grid snapping and measurement display in centimeters
- [ ] Wall selection and property editing interface
- [ ] Export functionality to JSON schema format

## Technical Details
**Core Canvas Components:**
- `WallDrawingCanvas` - Main Konva.js stage for drawing operations
- `WallRenderer` - Renders walls with thickness, materials, and openings
- `GeometryValidator` - Web Worker for geometric validation without UI blocking
- `GridManager` - Snap-to-grid functionality with customizable grid size
- `SelectionManager` - Multi-select capabilities for walls and objects

**State Management:**
- Zustand store for wall geometry data
- Optimistic updates with rollback on validation failure
- History management for undo/redo operations
- Real-time synchronization with backend for persistence

**Performance Optimization:**
- Canvas virtualization for large floor plans (20+ walls)
- Debounced validation to maintain 60fps during drawing
- Efficient re-rendering using Konva's layer system
- Memory management for complex geometric operations

**Validation Engine:**
- Self-intersection detection using line segment algorithms
- Wall overlap detection and automatic merging suggestions
- Minimum wall length and thickness validation
- Opening placement validation (doors/windows within wall bounds)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Project foundation and JSON schema definitions
- [ ] Konva.js and React integration setup
- [ ] Web Workers configuration for geometric validation
- [ ] Zustand store architecture defined

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside backend development)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Users can draw complete room layouts with walls, doors, windows
- [ ] Real-time validation prevents invalid geometry from being saved
- [ ] Canvas performance maintained at 60fps with complex layouts
- [ ] JSON export produces valid schema-compliant layout data
- [ ] All geometric operations have comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] UI is responsive and intuitive for non-technical users
