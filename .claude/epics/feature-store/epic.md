# Epic: feature-store

## Overview

Implementation of a complete interior design platform consisting of a web-based 2D floor plan editor, material/furniture management system, and pure C++ Unreal Engine rendering backend. The system enables users to create room layouts, select materials and furniture, then generate photorealistic renders through an automated pipeline.

## Architecture Decisions

**Frontend Strategy:**
- React + TypeScript with Konva.js for high-performance 2D canvas operations
- Zustand for state management to handle complex geometric data efficiently
- Web Workers for geometric validation to maintain 60fps UI performance
- Real-time validation engine to prevent invalid data from reaching backend

**Backend Strategy:**
- NestJS API with PostgreSQL for structured data and Redis for job queuing
- JSON schema validation on both ends to ensure data consistency
- SQS-based render job queue with retry mechanisms and status tracking
- S3 + CloudFront for asset storage and render output delivery

**Unreal Engine Strategy:**
- Pure C++ implementation for maximum performance and control
- Command-line automation with JSON input/output for reliable operation
- Procedural geometry generation using Unreal's native mesh building APIs
- Movie Render Pipeline integration for consistent high-quality output

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

**Core Editor Engine:**
- `WallDrawingCanvas` - Point-to-point wall construction with real-time validation
- `GeometryValidator` - Web Worker-based validation (self-intersection, overlap detection)
- `MaterialSelector` - Database-synced material picker with preview capabilities
- `FurniturePalette` - Drag-drop object placement with collision detection
- `CameraManager` - Panoramic and perspective camera placement tools
- `JSONExporter` - Schema-compliant layout serialization

**State Management:**
- Geometric data store (walls, openings, objects, cameras)
- Material library store with auto-sync from backend
- Render job status tracking with real-time updates
- Undo/redo system for all editor operations

### Backend Services

**Core APIs:**
- `/api/materials` - CRUD operations with auto-sync to frontend
- `/api/layouts` - Layout storage, versioning, and validation
- `/api/render-jobs` - Job submission, status tracking, result delivery
- `/api/assets` - Texture and 3D model management

**Data Models:**
- Material schema with texture references and Unreal mapping
- Layout schema matching the JSON specification exactly
- Render job tracking with progress and error states
- Asset metadata with validation status and processing results

### Infrastructure

**Core Unreal C++ Classes:**
- `ALayoutProcessor` - JSON parsing and scene coordination
- `UWallGenerator` - Procedural mesh generation with Boolean operations
- `UMaterialManager` - Dynamic material instance creation and assignment
- `UFurnitureSpawner` - Asset loading and precise positioning
- `ACameraController` - Multi-camera render management
- `URenderJobExecutor` - Movie Render Pipeline automation

**Deployment Considerations:**
- Windows-only Unreal worker nodes initially
- Horizontal scaling of render workers based on queue depth
- Asset CDN for global texture/model delivery
- Automated cleanup of temporary render files

## Implementation Strategy

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Start with simple geometric shapes, progressively add complexity
- Implement comprehensive JSON validation to catch errors early
- Build extensive automated testing for geometric operations
- Create fallback mechanisms for render failures

**Development Phases:**
- Phase 1: Core 2D editor with basic geometric validation
- Phase 2: Material system and data synchronization
- Phase 3: Unreal C++ backend with procedural generation
- Phase 4: End-to-end integration and optimization

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests for all geometric validation functions
- Integration tests for JSON schema compliance
- End-to-end tests for complete render pipeline
- Performance testing for complex layouts (20+ walls, 50+ objects)

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Frontend Editor Foundation** - Canvas-based wall drawing with real-time validation
- [ ] **Material Management System** - Database sync and selection interface
- [ ] **Furniture Placement Engine** - Drag-drop with collision detection and snapping
- [ ] **Camera & Render Interface** - Multi-camera placement and job submission
- [ ] **Backend API & Data Layer** - REST APIs and database schema
- [ ] **Unreal C++ Core Classes** - Layout processor and geometry generators
- [ ] **Render Pipeline Integration** - Movie Render Pipeline automation
- [ ] **End-to-End Integration** - Complete workflow testing and optimization

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- Unreal Engine 5.6+ installation and C++ development tools
- High-quality material texture library (4K PBR assets)
- Furniture 3D model library in compatible formats (FBX/GLB)
- Windows development environment for Unreal compilation

**Internal Dependencies:**
- Database setup for materials and layout storage
- File storage infrastructure for assets and render outputs
- Message queue system for render job management
- Development environment setup for React + Unreal workflow

**Critical Path Items:**
- JSON schema finalization and validation implementation
- Unreal C++ project setup and initial class structure
- Material library creation and Unreal material instance mapping

## Success Criteria (Technical)

**Functional Validation:**
- Complete room layouts can be drawn and validated in under 30 seconds
- Material selection updates appear instantly with 100% accuracy
- Furniture placement with collision detection works reliably
- JSON export produces valid schema-compliant data
- Unreal C++ processes layouts and generates accurate geometry
- End-to-end render pipeline completes successfully

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- 2D editor maintains 60fps with complex layouts (20+ walls)
- Geometric validation completes within 16ms per operation
- Material application in Unreal is 100% accurate to wall assignments
- Complete render workflow (design â†’ image) under 15 minutes
- 95% successful render completion rate with retry mechanisms

**Quality Gates:**
- Zero invalid layouts reach the Unreal backend
- Material application accuracy of 100% (correct materials on correct walls)
- Furniture positioning accuracy within 1cm tolerance
- Render output quality meets photorealistic standards
- System handles edge cases gracefully with clear error messages

## Estimated Effort

**Overall Timeline:** 8 weeks for complete P1 implementation

**Resource Requirements:**
- 1 Frontend developer (React + TypeScript expertise)
- 1 Backend developer (Node.js + database experience)
- 1 Unreal C++ developer (advanced C++ and Unreal Engine knowledge)
- 1 Technical lead for coordination and architecture decisions

**Critical Path Items:**
- Weeks 1-2: Frontend editor foundation and geometric validation
- Weeks 3-4: Backend APIs and material management system
- Weeks 5-6: Unreal C++ implementation and procedural generation
- Weeks 7-8: Integration, testing, and performance optimization

**Risk Factors:**
- Pure C++ Unreal implementation complexity may extend timeline by 1-2 weeks
- Complex geometric validation edge cases may require additional iteration
- Material system synchronization may need refinement based on testing results
