# Task: Backend API and Database Architecture

## Description
Implement the complete backend API using NestJS with PostgreSQL for data persistence, Redis for job queuing, and comprehensive endpoints for materials, layouts, render jobs, and asset management. Includes real-time synchronization and job queue management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] RESTful API endpoints for materials CRUD operations
- [ ] Layout storage and versioning with JSON schema validation
- [ ] Render job queue management with status tracking
- [ ] Asset management API for textures and 3D models
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket connections for job status updates
- [ ] Database migrations and seed data for initial material library
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- [ ] API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger integration
- [ ] Authentication and authorization framework (JWT-based)

## Technical Details
**Core API Endpoints:**
- `POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /api/materials` - Material library management
- `POST/GET /api/layouts` - Layout persistence with versioning
- `POST/GET /api/render-jobs` - Job submission and status tracking
- `GET/POST /api/assets` - Asset upload and metadata management
- `WebSocket /api/ws` - Real-time status updates and notifications

**Database Schema:**
- Materials table with texture references and Unreal mapping data
- Layouts table with JSON validation and version history
- Render jobs table with status, progress, and error tracking
- Assets table with file metadata and processing status
- Users table with authentication and permission management

**Job Queue Architecture:**
- Redis-based job queue with retry mechanisms and dead letter queues
- Job prioritization (preview vs final renders)
- Worker health monitoring and automatic failover
- Queue depth monitoring for auto-scaling decisions

**Data Validation:**
- JSON schema validation for layout data consistency
- File type and size validation for asset uploads
- Rate limiting and quota management per user
- Input sanitization and SQL injection prevention

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Database setup and connection configuration
- [ ] PostgreSQL schema design and migration scripts
- [ ] Redis configuration for job queue management
- [ ] S3 or equivalent file storage for assets and render outputs

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside frontend)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All API endpoints functional with proper error handling
- [ ] Database schema supports all required operations
- [ ] Job queue processes render requests reliably
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket updates work correctly
- [ ] API performance meets requirements (< 200ms response time)
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints
- [ ] API documentation complete and accurate
- [ ] Authentication system secure and functional
