# Task: Camera System and Render Pipeline Integration

## Description
Implement the camera placement system for panoramic and perspective views, integrate with Movie Render Pipeline for high-quality output, and create automated rendering workflow with job queue processing and file output management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Camera placement tools in frontend for panoramic and perspective views
- [ ] `ACameraController` C++ class for multi-camera render management
- [ ] Movie Render Pipeline integration with preview and final quality presets
- [ ] Automated rendering workflow triggered by API calls
- [ ] Panoramic camera support with 360° equirectangular output
- [ ] Perspective camera with configurable FOV and look-at positioning
- [ ] Render job status tracking with progress updates
- [ ] Automated file output to specified locations (S3/CloudFront)
- [ ] Error handling and retry mechanisms for failed renders

## Technical Details
**Frontend Camera Interface:**
- `CameraPlacementTool` for dragging cameras onto floor plan
- Visual indicators for camera position, direction, and field of view
- Real-time validation (minimum 30cm distance from walls)
- Camera settings panel (height, FOV, orientation, render quality)

**Unreal Camera System:**
```cpp
class INTERIORDESIGN_API ACameraController : public AActor
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
    bool SetupPanoramicCamera(FVector Position, float YawRotation);

    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
    bool SetupPerspectiveCamera(FVector Position, FVector LookAt, float FOV);

    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
    void ExecuteRender(ERenderQuality Quality);
};
```

**Movie Render Pipeline Integration:**
- Custom render presets (pano_preview, pano_final, still_preview, still_final)
- Automated queue processing with job prioritization
- Output format management (WebP/JPG with configurable quality)
- Render progress callbacks and status reporting

**Automated Workflow:**
- Command-line triggered rendering from JSON job specifications
- Automatic scene setup, camera positioning, and render execution
- File naming convention with project/version/camera identification
- Upload to S3 with CloudFront distribution for global access

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Project foundation and JSON schema for camera definitions
- [ ] Task 005: Core Unreal C++ classes and scene generation
- [ ] Movie Render Pipeline plugin configuration
- [ ] S3/CloudFront setup for render output storage

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Users can place and configure cameras in 2D editor
- [ ] Camera placement data exports correctly in JSON format
- [ ] Unreal system creates cameras at exact specified positions
- [ ] Panoramic renders produce seamless 360° equirectangular images
- [ ] Perspective renders match camera settings accurately
- [ ] Render pipeline processes jobs automatically from queue
- [ ] Output files upload to CDN with proper naming convention
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure scenarios with retry logic
