# Task: Frontend Render Interface and Status Management

## Description
Implement the frontend interface for render job submission, real-time status tracking, and result display. Includes render queue management, progress monitoring, and image viewer for panoramic and still renders.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Render submission interface with quality selection (preview/final)
- [ ] Real-time render job status updates via WebSocket connection
- [ ] Progress indicators showing queue position and render progress
- [ ] Image viewer for panoramic (360°) and still render results
- [ ] Render history with job status, timestamps, and download links
- [ ] Error handling with clear messages and retry options
- [ ] Batch render submission for multiple cameras simultaneously
- [ ] Render settings panel (resolution, format, quality presets)
- [ ] Download and sharing functionality for completed renders

## Technical Details
**Render Submission Flow:**
- `RenderJobSubmitter` component with camera selection and quality options
- JSON payload generation with complete layout and camera specifications
- API integration with backend render job endpoints
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on submission failure

**Real-time Status Tracking:**
- WebSocket connection for live render job updates
- `RenderStatusManager` with queue position and progress tracking
- Visual progress indicators (progress bars, status badges, ETA display)
- Auto-refresh for job status changes and completion notifications

**Result Display System:**
- `PanoramicViewer` using Photo Sphere Viewer for 360° image display
- `StillImageViewer` with zoom, pan, and download functionality
- Thumbnail gallery for render history and comparison
- Hotspot navigation between multiple panoramic viewpoints

**State Management:**
- Render job store with status tracking and history
- WebSocket message handling and state synchronization
- Error state management with retry mechanisms
- Caching of completed render results

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Camera placement tools in floor plan editor
- [ ] Task 004: Backend API for render job submission and status
- [ ] WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates
- [ ] Photo Sphere Viewer library for panoramic display

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside Unreal implementation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Users can submit render jobs with proper camera and quality selection
- [ ] Real-time status updates show accurate progress information
- [ ] Completed renders display correctly in appropriate viewers
- [ ] Error states provide clear feedback and recovery options
- [ ] WebSocket connections handle disconnection and reconnection gracefully
- [ ] Render history persists across browser sessions
- [ ] Performance optimized for viewing large high-resolution images
- [ ] All user interactions covered by comprehensive testing
