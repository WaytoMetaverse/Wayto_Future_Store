# Task: Project Foundation and Development Environment Setup

## Description
Set up the complete development environment and project foundation for the interior design platform, including React frontend, NestJS backend, PostgreSQL database, and pure C++ Unreal Engine project structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React + TypeScript project created with Vite build system
- [ ] NestJS backend project initialized with TypeScript configuration
- [ ] PostgreSQL database set up with connection configuration
- [ ] Redis instance configured for job queuing
- [ ] Pure C++ Unreal Engine 5.6+ project created (no Blueprints)
- [ ] JSON schema definitions created and shared between projects
- [ ] Development environment documentation completed
- [ ] Git repository structure with proper .gitignore files
- [ ] Basic CI/CD pipeline configuration prepared

## Technical Details
**Frontend Setup:**
- Initialize React + TypeScript with Vite for fast development
- Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode
- Install Konva.js for canvas operations and Zustand for state management
- Set up path aliases and absolute imports

**Backend Setup:**
- Initialize NestJS with TypeScript and set up modular architecture
- Configure PostgreSQL with TypeORM for entity management
- Set up Redis connection for job queue management
- Create environment configuration with validation

**Unreal Project:**
- Create new C++ Unreal Engine project (no Blueprint dependencies)
- Set up Movie Render Pipeline plugin and required dependencies
- Configure project for command-line automation
- Create basic C++ class structure skeleton

**Shared Resources:**
- Define JSON schema for layout data (walls, openings, objects, cameras)
- Create validation schemas using Zod (frontend) and class-validator (backend)
- Set up shared constants and type definitions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Unreal Engine 5.6+ installation with C++ development tools
- [ ] Node.js 18+ for frontend and backend development
- [ ] PostgreSQL 14+ database server
- [ ] Redis server for job management
- [ ] Git repository access and permissions

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: false (foundation must be completed first)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All projects compile and run without errors
- [ ] Database connections established and tested
- [ ] JSON schema validation works in both frontend and backend
- [ ] Unreal C++ project compiles with basic class structure
- [ ] Development environment documented for team onboarding
- [ ] Version control setup with proper branching strategy
